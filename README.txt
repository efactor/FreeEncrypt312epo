=================
aka FreeEncrypeRepo

Encrypt your code so even though you are using a public repository it really is private.
Decryption is only done on the local computer to keep your code safe.

Looking to provide such features:
-Code hosting platform independent
-AES 128/256 bit password based encryption with salt
-Filename encryption
-Local repo encryption/ decryption
